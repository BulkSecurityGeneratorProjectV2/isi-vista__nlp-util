nlp-util
===============

This is a collection of various utilities that have been found useful in the course 
of doing NLP research, although little of it is NLP-specific. This is a fork of
BBN's open-source utility code at https://github.com/BBN-E/bue-common-open

This utility code originated at Raytheon BBN Technologies and all code through 1 October 2017
is copyright BBN.  All later updates are copyright USC ISI. Both are under the MIT license.
Contributors are listed in `history.md`. Many thanks to BBN for open-sourcing it!
